J&J Studios is focused on making it easier for students and hobbyists to integrate sensors into their projects.  For someone new to electronics a breadboard, jumper wires, breakout boards, and header pins can be intimidating.  Many people are already familiar with a URI syntax for getting and setting parameters and receiving data in JSON encapsulated packets.  Therefore our products focus on translating the language a sensor speaks into that more familiar format.  

J&J Studios is breaking the barrier between a breakout board and a LEGO&reg; Mindstorms&reg; sensor.
