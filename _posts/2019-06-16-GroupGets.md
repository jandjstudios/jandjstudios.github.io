OK, not really.  But the campaigns for the [datum-Distance][1], [datum-IMU][2], and [datum-Light][3] sensors on GroupGets certainly are!  

Each sensor in the datum product line is meant to bridge the gap between a LEGO&reg; Mindstorms&reg; sensor and a breakout board.  No more breadboard.  No more soldering iron.  Just plug in the USB cable, fire up your favorite terminal program, and watch the data appear before your eyes.

Each sensor supports a URI style command syntax and returns the data in a JSON encapsulated data packet.  Check out the full capabilities of each one on the campaign pages and [here](/datum/)!
